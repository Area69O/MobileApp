<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	Our application aims to reduce or prevent impulse shopping. As many people will find the
items they bought didnâ€™t meet their requirements, or add value to their lives, we want to make an mobile application which 
help people decide whether this item is useful and calculate cost/value = performance.  The main users of our products will be college students who like shopping and may have economic issues.
