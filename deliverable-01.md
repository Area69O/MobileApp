# Interview Questions and Answers

## Introduction:
Our application aims to reduce or prevent impulse shopping. As many people will find the items they bought didn’t meet their requirements, or add value to their lives, we want to make an mobile application which 
help people decide whether this item is useful and calculate cost/value performance.  The main users of our products will be college students who like shopping and may have economic issues.

## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments:
For our projects we predict that the younger crowd would likely be in need of something like this, older teens and young adults that are not as experienced in shopping yet we also don’t think gender will be a huge deciding factor in this. We see somewhere that may be commonly shopped at being a potentially big issue area, like  grocery stores and big chain retailers or maybe niche markets (clothing and crafting maybe). We also do not know for sure that everyone we interview has impulsive buying habits like we do.

## Interview Question Template
